    "2\nThe Foundation of React\nReact is a JavaScript library for creating interactive user interfaces using components. It was\ncreated by Facebook in 2011 for use on Facebook’s newsfeed and on Instagram. In 2013, the\nfirst version of React was released to the public as open source software. Today, it’s used by\nmany of the largest websites and mobile apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Reddit,\nDropbox, Airbnb, and thousands of others.\nWriting user interfaces with React requires a bit of a shift in how you think about web applica-\ntions. You need to understand what React is, how it works at a higher level, and the computer\nscience ideas and patterns that it’s based on. In this chapter, you’ll learn:\n➤➤ Why it’s called React.\n➤➤ What a Virtual DOM does.\n➤➤ The difference between composition and inheritance.\n➤➤ The difference between declarative and imperative programming.\n➤➤ The meaning of “idiomatic” with regard to React.\nWHAT’S IN A NAME?",

In this chapter, you’ll learn:\n➤➤ Why it’s called React.\n➤➤ What a Virtual DOM does.\n➤➤ The difference between composition and inheritance.\n➤➤ The difference between declarative and imperative programming.\n➤➤ The meaning of “idiomatic” with regard to React.\nWHAT’S IN A NAME?\nLet’s start with the name “React.” Facebook designed React in response to its need to be able\nto efficiently update websites in response to events. Events that can trigger updates in websites\ninclude user input, new data coming into the application from other websites and data sources,\nand data coming into the application from sensors (such as location data from GPS chips).\nTraditionally, the way that web applications have dealt with data that changes over time is to\nrefresh themselves every so often, checking for new data in the process.

In an MVC application, the View sends input to\nthe Controller, which passes data between the data layer and the View. React is only concerned with\nthe V in MVC. It takes data as input and presents it to the user in some form.\nFigure 2-1 shows a diagram of the MVC pattern.\nMODEL\nupdates modifies\nuser input\nVIEW CONTROLLER\nFIGURE 2- 1: The MVC pattern\nReact itself doesn’t care whether the user is using a mobile phone, a tablet, a desktop web browser, a\nscreen reader, a command-l ine interface, or any other kind of device or interface that may be invented",

React just renders components. How those components get presented to the user is up\nto a separate library.\nThe library that handles rendering of React components in web browsers is called ReactDOM. If you\nwant to render React elements to native mobile apps, you use React Native. If you want to render\nReact components to static HTML, you can use ReactDOMServer.\nReactDOM has a number of functions for interfacing between React and web browsers, but the one\nthat every React application makes use of is called ReactDOM.render.

It\nconverts HTML, styles, and content into nodes that can be operated on using JavaScript.\nIf you’ve ever used the getElementById function or set the innerHTML of an element, you’ve inter-\nacted with the DOM using JavaScript. Changes to the DOM cause changes to what you see in your\nweb browser, and updates made in the web browser (such as when you enter data into a form) cause\nchanges to the DOM.\nCompared to other kinds of JavaScript code, DOM manipulation is slow and inefficient. This is\nbecause whenever the DOM changes, the browser has to check whether the change will require the\npage to be redrawn and then the redrawing has to happen.\nAdding to the difficulty of DOM manipulation is that the DOM’s functions aren’t always easy to use\nand some of them have excessively long names like Document.getElementsByClassName.

For both\nof these reasons, many different JavaScript DOM manipulation libraries have been created. The single\nmost popular and widely used DOM manipulation library of all time was jQuery. It gave web devel-\nopers an easy way to make updates to the DOM, and that changed the way we build user interfaces\non the web.\nAlthough jQuery made DOM manipulation easier, it left it up to programmers to program specifically\nwhen and how changes to the DOM would happen.

The result was often inefficient user interfaces\nthat were slower both to download and to respond to user interactions because of their use of jQuery.\nAs a result, jQuery got a reputation for being slow.\nWhen the engineers at Facebook designed React, they decided to take the details of how and when\nthe DOM is modified out of the hands of programmers. To do this, they created a layer between\nthe code that the programmer writes and the DOM. They called this intermediary layer the\nVirtual DOM.\nHere’s how it works:\n1. A programmer writes React code to render a user interface, which results in a single React\nelement being returned.\n2.

React components are independent pieces that can be reused and that can pass data to\neach other.\nA component can be something as simple as a button or it can be more complex, such as a navigation\nbar that’s made up of a collection of buttons and dropdowns.\nAs the programmer, it’s your job to decide how big or how small each component in your application\nshould be, but a good rule of thumb to think about is the idea of single responsibility.",

Robert C. Martin, also known as “Uncle Bob,” is\none of the most important thinkers and writers on software design. He described the single responsi-\nbility principle this way:\nSingle Responsibility means that a class [or what we call a “component” in React]\nshould have only one reason to change.\nComposition vs. Inheritance\nIn object- oriented programming (OOP), it’s common to create variations of classes that inherit prop-",

For example, a program might have a class called Button, which might\nhave a child class called SubmitButton. SubmitButton would inherit all of the properties of Button,\nand then override or extend them to create its unique functionality and look.\nRather than using inheritance to create more specific components to deal with specific cases (such as\na submit button), React encourages the creation of a single component that is more broadly reusable\nbut that can be configured by passing data into it and then combining it with other components to\nhandle more specific cases.",

Traditionally, the job of a programmer has been to break down\ncomplex processes into steps so that a computer can perform them. For example, if you want to pro-\ngram a robot to make you a sandwich, you might start by figuring out the high- level steps involved in\nthe process:\n1. Get two slices of bread.\n2. Find a knife.\n3. Get the peanut butter.\n4. Use the knife to spread the peanut butter.\n5.

Use visual sensors to locate bread.\n1aa. If bread is found, move toward it.\n1ab. If bread is not found, return to step 1.\n1b. Use grabber arm to attempt opening of bread package.\nYou get the idea. By breaking down a complex process into small steps, a task eventually becomes\nsimple enough for a computer to perform.

The idea of a library is to simplify common tasks that programmers need\nto do frequently so that they can just focus on writing the code that makes a program unique.\nSummary ❘ 21\nIf you had enough time and knowledge, you could rewrite every bit of the React library yourself\nusing JavaScript— but, of course, there’s no reason to do that, because the React developers have done\nit for you.\nReact Is Not a Database Server",

Instead, React\nuser interfaces (like every web and mobile web user interface) communicate with server-s ide data-\nbases over the internet to store and receive data such as login information, ecommerce transaction\ndata, news feeds, and so forth.\nThe data that React uses to make user interfaces dynamic, and the data that you’re viewing at any\none time in a React user interface (what we call “session” data), is not persistent.

Unless your React\nuser interface saves session data in the web browser (using cookies or the browser’s local storage), it\nall gets erased when you navigate to a different URL or refresh your browser window.\nReact Is Not a Development Environment\nAs you saw in the book’s Introduction, you’ll use plenty of different tools to program with React.\nCollectively, these are known as your development environment. I present the most commonly used\ntools (and, in some cases, just my own personal preferences), but there’s nothing about React that\nrequires you to use these specific tools.

It’s possible to write perfect React code using any tools you want, or using no tools\nat all (other than a text editor).\nReact Is Not the Perfect Solution to Every Problem\nReact works well for many types of applications, but it’s not always the best solution. This is true of\nany JavaScript library, and it’s probably true of every single tool ever invented. It’s important to know\nabout a wide variety of different languages and libraries so that you can make good choices and\nknow when the tools you prefer to use or that you know the best are the best and when they might\nnot be the best.\nSUMMARY",

In the end, however, writing React user interfaces is straightforward:\n1. You write components to describe how the user interface should look and act.\n2. React renders your components to create a tree of nodes.\n3. A React renderer figures out the differences between the latest rendered component tree and\nthe previous one and updates the user interface accordingly.\n22 ❘ CHAPTER 2 The FoundaTion oF ReacT\nIn this chapter, you learned:",

In this chapter,\nyou’ll learn:\n➤➤ How to write JSX.\n➤➤ How modules work in JavaScript.\n➤➤ What a transpiler does.\n➤➤ How to include literal JavaScript in JSX code.\n➤➤ How to do conditional rendering in React.\n➤➤ How to render children in JSX.\nJSX IS NOT HTML",
